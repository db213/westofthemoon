# The Laugevagur Trail

## 6 days of camping in the Icelandic Highlands

_August 29, 2024 by [Daphne](/)_

The Laugevagur Trail is perhaps one of the most famous trekking routes in the world, and after having
finally experienced it for myself, I can see why. The distances, difficulty, and logistics are all
relatively accessible and deliver excellent value for effort in the form of endless landscapes that
change dramatically from hour to hour and have you seriously questioning whether you're actually
still on Earth.

The trail (and its extension the Fimmorduhvals Trail) are extensively covered by various different
blogs, Youtube channels, and guides, but read on to hear about my particular experience on the trail.

## The Route

I hiked from north to south, starting in Landmannalaugar and ending in Skogar. This is the more common
direction and overall entails a little less elevation gain, though not by a significant margin. But it
meant that I could book in advance the highland bus to Landmannalaugar and then have the flexibility for
the rest of the trail to take rest days or stay in place due to inclement weather without worrying about
catching a specific bus back to civilization at the end of the trip.

I also decided to camp the trail rather than attempt to book one of the very limited places in the mountain
huts. It would be my first time camping a through hike, and I calculated it be a good beginner's
backpacking route due to the numerous campsites en route that provided facilities and drinking water and
the relatively friendly sounding daily distances and elevation gain (there are enough campsite where you never need to hike
further than 20km in a day). The main complication would be budgeting for and packing in food.

## Day 0

I stayed one night in Landmannalaugar before beginning the trail. This allowed me to go for a full day
hike starting and ending in Landmannalaugar on the day of arrival without having to carry all of my camping gear
and food. Landmannalaugar is an utterly gorgeous, out-of-this-world location and I highly recommend taking a little
bit of extra time to explore it.

I picked out a roughly 15km trail on the map, and started it with very little context besides the hint of the contour
lines on the map of what it would be like. There was one section, about 10km in, that I was a little suspicious might be a bit
_spicy_. Almost immediately after leaving Landmannalaugar, there was a stream crossing, after which a fair few easy uphill
kilometers to the summit of the peak Skali. The trail was well marked and I didn't once have to consult my map or GPS. I only
met 5 people on the trail, despite the popularity of Landmannalaugar as a hiking destination.

I was lucky to have gorgeous weather and the views were phenomenal. Black mountains streaked with white, snow-filled valleys to the south, orange pinnacled summits to the east, rolling orange and red ridges streaked on the sides with vibrant green moss to the west, the formidable blue mountain Blajokull to the north, and steam rising from cracks in the earth far beneath you on all sides.

Eventually I realized I had blithely missed a turn off from the main path heading west onto a smaller detour heading north
that I was hoping to take toward Blajokull, which I was then planning to summit and then descend into the usual tourist trail
through the lava field next to Landmannalaugar. I had to backtrack 1.5km to regain my intended path. I was now approaching
the part of the trail where the contour lines on the map stopped looking so much like neat concentric circles, but more
like a jumbled mess of squiggles.

The path became increasingly sketchy, traversing some extremely loose dirt terrain steeply down onto one of these bright orange
ridges that dot the landscape around Landmannalaugar. But once I finally set foot on the ridge itself I knew it was time to
turn around. While the angle of the slope didn't look desperately steep, the terrain may as well have been made out of glassy ice
given the amount of grip it provided. Given I was on a ridge, there was a pretty steep and unforgiving drop off on either side of me, and I didn't want to think about what a slip might have entailed. I carefully tried to descend backwards and to awkwardly bum shuffle my way down, but after giving it a few carefully considered goes, I decided it was best to just retrace my steps, take
the main trail out west again and reconnect with the Laugevagur Trail in order to get back to Landmannalaugar. It was a bit of a
shame, because the path traversing the top of that ridge looked nothing short of _epic_. Maybe someone more sure-footed and braver
than me can let me know what it's like and send me some photos of the experience that I missed.

The remainder of the trail didn't give me any difficulties, though my day had unexpectedly gone from 15km to 22km, equal in
distance and elevation gain with the two most difficult days of the trail that awaited me ahead. My intention had been to bathe
in the geothermal pools in Landmannalaugar that evening, but after a later than expected return, cooking dinner, and washing up,
I decided I would visit the pools in the morning before starting the trail and just call it a night.

## Day 1

The morning of the first day of the trail I started in style by bathing in the geothermal pool in Landmannalaugar. It was, and
I am not exaggerating, glorious. The views are beautiful, there were only 3 other people in the water, and the warm water felt
amazing. Then a quick breakfast, camp broken, and I was on my way!

I'd already done the first 5km of the days hike by accident and in the wrong direction the day before, but it's such a
fascinating and alien area that I didn't mind repeating it in the slightest. After those first 5km you exchange the vibrant
orange and red hills and ridges of Landmannalaugar for the desolate, black, rolling plateau of Hraftinnunsker. It's a steady
climb up to the pass where the Hraftinnunsker hut and campsite sits, but not a difficult one. On the way you pass fumaroles
literally right next to the trail (why do I want to touch the danger water so badly?!?) and traverse between and over large
patches of snow.

The route down from Hraftinnunsker proved a little interesting. Some of the established path was covered by snow drifts and snow
bridges. The alternative path that obviously most hikers were taking went over a snow bridge that looked dodgy as all hell. I
spent a while finding an alternative route around that didn't involve crossing a snow bridge only to immediately be confronted
by exactly the same problem hardly 300 meters later.

Thankfully the remaining snow patches I traversed that day were not as obviously worrying as the first one, and hikers in front
of and behind me were happy to plow through them without a second thought. I simply tried not to think about it too much and
carried on over the remainder of them (and there were quite a few - maybe 6 in total that day).

Eventually you find yourself again surrounded by the orangey-red terrain that dominated the landscape in Landmannalaugar. More
steam, more fumaroles, more sulfuric smells. Wherever there is a stream or water, there is also unbelievably vibrant green moss
growing all around it, a stark contrast with the completely barren and flora-devoid landscapes everywhere else you look.

And after an uneventful river crossing, you crest the second pass of the day to be met with what's definitely one of the most
stunning views of the trail. The view looking down towards Alftavatn is almost indescribable. I can say with certainty at least
that my photos didn't remotely do it justice. Coming over that crest, the landscape immediately changes
